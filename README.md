# 🎮 **Engine: OpenGL Engine with a Dash of Egui!** 🎨

Welcome to **Engine**,
Another engine project with OpenGL, because I'm not very original. You'll find better engines elsewhere, but this one was made with heart.

 Built with modern C++20 and packed with awesome libraries like **glm**, **glad**, **glfw**, **egui**, and **fmt**.
## 🚀 **Features**

- **Modern C++20**: Leveraging the latest language features for performance and safety.
- **ECS Architecture**: Flexible and efficient Entity-Component-System design.
- **Components**: Transform, Mesh, Camera, and more!
- **Interactive GUI**: Thanks to **egui**, creating interfaces is a breeze.
- **Robust Libraries**: Utilizing **glm** for math, **glad** & **glfw** for OpenGL, and **fmt** for formatting.

## 📅 **Roadmap**

We're on an exciting journey to make Engine the go-to OpenGL engine. Here's what's on the horizon:

1. ### 🛠 ~~**Setup**~~
    - ~~**Initialize** the engine with all necessary configurations.~~
    - ~~**Integrate** essential libraries: glm, glad, glfw, egui, and fmt.~~

2. ### 🧩 **ECS (Entity-Component-System)**
    - ~~**Design** a robust ECS framework for flexibility and performance.~~
    - ~~**Implement** efficient entity management and component storage.~~

3. ### 📐 **Transform Component**
    - **Add** position, rotation, and scale functionalities.
    - **Enable** hierarchical transformations for complex objects.

4. ### 🖼 **Mesh Component**
    - **Support** for various mesh formats.
    - **Optimize** mesh data for real-time rendering.

5. ### 🎥 **Camera Component**
    - **Implement** perspective and orthographic cameras.
    - **Add** camera controls for smooth navigation.

6. ### 🌍 **Scene**
    - **Create** scene management for organizing entities.
    - **Enable** loading and unloading of scenes dynamically.

7. ### ✏️ **Gizmo**
    - **Integrate** interactive gizmos for object manipulation.
    - **Support** translation, rotation, and scaling tools.

8. ### 📦 **Mesh Loader**
    - **Develop** loaders for popular mesh formats (e.g., OBJ, FBX).
    - **Ensure** efficient parsing and error handling.

9. ### 🔄 **Event System**
    - **Build** a robust event dispatcher.
    - **Facilitate** communication between different engine systems.

10. ### 💡 **Lighting**
    - **Implement** various light types: directional, point, and spotlights.
    - **Add** support for multiple light sources and dynamic lighting.

11. ### 🕶 **Shadow**
    - **Develop** shadow mapping techniques.
    - **Optimize** shadows for performance and quality.
